Hi, my name is Hem Poudyal. I come from the beautiful Himalayan Nation- Nepal. My interest overlaps **Engineering** and **Design**. My curiosity and interest has led me to establish myself as an **iOS Engineer**. My working style is being free, coming up with new approaches to solve underlying problems in development and enjoying every moment while I am building a product.

I have designed and developed more than 15 advanced applications from use cases and functional requirements.

It has been **over Seven years** since I have started developing Mobile Apps on 2013. In recent years, I have even led a Startup for 3 years where I along with my team used to develop lot of applications. I have experience of leading team and managing projects as well.

> I believe in doing what we love and finding pleasure out of it. People are stressed even without working, while some people are happy working day and night on the projects they are passionate about

***

As of now, I am working remotely from home, mostly working on projects based on **Swift**, **Objective-C**, **Firebase** and the new **Swift UI**. I have decided to explore iOS contract/ **freelance work full-time** for the rest of upcoming years.


Talking about my interests, I enjoy to:

* Work on My side projects
* Research and write blogs
* Build mini Indie Mobile Apps
* Take Photographs and connect with nature 
* Travel far whenever I can
